### Hello! I code very dumb stuff sometimes.

<br>

15 year old, professional idiot & moron, sometimes game + software dev :D

<br>

- I know C#, HTML, HaxeFlixel, a bit of lua, and other various random languages
- Making very dumb internet stuff for about 8-9 years
- Coder, gamedev, composer, video editor, and other stuff
- I occasionally mod games when i'm bored
- Scratch user back in 2017-2019
- I made that one thing (you know the one)

<br>

I have a very barebones [website](https://cuzsie.github.io) (it's literally just links....) but it's going to be updated! (when I get motivation to, that is)

Discord is 'cuzsie' in case you need to contact me!
